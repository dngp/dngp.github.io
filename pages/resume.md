<!-- <div class="abstract" style="display:none" id="HKNRSSS:SPIN:23">Efficient state-space exploration
has a significant impact on reachability analysis in explicit model checking
and existing tools use several variants of search heuristics and random walks
in order to overcome the state-space explosion problem. We contribute with a
novel approach based on a random search strategy, where actions are assigned
dynamically (on-the-fly) updated potencies, changing according to the
variations of a heuristic distance to the goal configuration as encountered
during the state-space search. We implement our general idea into a Petri net
model checker TAPAAL and document its efficiency on a large benchmark of Petri
net models from the annual Model Checking Contest. The experiments show that
our heuristic search outperforms the standard search approaches in multiple
metrics and that it constitutes a worthy addition to the portfolio of classical
search strategies. </div>
